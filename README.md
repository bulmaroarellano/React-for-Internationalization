# Test your knowledge!

Suppose you are creating your personal portfolio page, and as part of that page, you want to output some basic information about yourself (e.g., your name or age). You could use React and build a React component that outputs this kind of information, as outlined in the following activity.

The aim is to create a React app as you learned it in the previous chapter (i.e., create it via npx create-react-app, run npm start to start the development server) and edit the App.js file such that you output some basic information about yourself. You could, for example output your full name, address, job title or other kinds of information. In the end, it is up to you what content you want to output and which HTML elements you choose.

The idea behind this first exercise is that you practice project creation and working with JSX code.

The steps are as follows:

1.- Create a new React project via npx create-react-app.
2.- Edit the App.js file in the /src folder of the created project and return JSX code with any HTML elements of your choice to output basic information about yourself.
