# Activity 2.2: Creating a React App to Log Your Goals for This Book 

Suppose you are adding a new section to your portfolio site, where you plan to track your learning progress. As part of this page, you plan to define and output your main goals for this book (e.g., "Learn about key React features", "Do all the exercises", etc.). 

The aim of this activity is to create another new React project in which you add multiple new components. Each goal will be represented by a separate component, and all these goal components will be grouped together into another component that lists all main goals. In addition, you can add an extra header component that contains the main title for the webpage. 

Perform the following steps to complete this activity:

Create a new React project by running npx create-react-app my-app. You can replace my-app with any name of your choice, and you can run this command in any fitting place on your system (e.g., on your desktop). Start the development web server by running npm start inside the created project folder. 
Create a new /src/components folder in the project 
In the /src/components folder, create multiple component filesâ€”for example, FirstGoal.js, SecondGoal.js, ThirdGoal.js, GoalList.js and Header.js
